                Sanjhi, the traditional art of paper cutting, holds a sacred
                place in Vaishnavite temples, especially during Pitra Paksha.
                These intricate designs often depict Radha and Lord Krishna,
                symbolizing devotion and remembrance. Sanjhi appears in many
                forms—floral, wall-mounted, cow-dung based, and the delicate Jal
                Sanjhi, where stencils and colored powders create fleeting
                patterns on water, capturing divine beauty in its most ephemeral
                form.
