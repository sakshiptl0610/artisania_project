                Discovered by painter J. Swaminathan in Patangarh, Madhya
                Pradesh, Jangarh Singh Shyam introduced the world to Gond art
                through his unique style of lines, dots, and dashes. His work
                gained global fame with exhibitions in Paris and Tokyo. Though
                his life ended tragically in Japan, his artistic legacy
                continues through his family, keeping the Gond tradition alive.
