                Tholu Bommalata, the shadow puppet theatre of Andhra Pradesh and
                Telangana, blends leathercraft, puppetry, and storytelling into
                a mesmerizing art form. Traditionally performed during Shivratri
                nights outside Shiva temples, it brought to life tales from the
                Ramayana and Mahabharata through vividly colored puppets casting
                shadows on illuminated screens. Today, though adapted to modern
                themes and shorter performances, this ancient craft continues to
                enchant audiences—preserving the timeless magic of India’s
                shadow puppetry.
