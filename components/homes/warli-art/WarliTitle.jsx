                Warli art belongs to the Warli tribe from the coastal regions of
                Maharashtra and Gujarat. Originally hunter-gatherers, they later
                settled into farming due to new forest laws during British rule.
                Their art reflects their close bond with nature and is made
                during weddings, childbirth, and festivals. Traditionally
                painted by married women, Warli paintings use white rice paste
                on mud walls coated with cow dung or red earth. A common design
                is the Lagna Chaukat (Marriage Square), painted before a
                wedding.
