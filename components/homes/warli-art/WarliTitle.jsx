                Warli art originates from the Warli tribe living in the coastal
                regions of Maharashtra and Gujarat. Once hunter-gatherers, they
                later adopted farming after British forest laws restricted their
                traditional lifestyle. Deeply connected to nature, Warli
                paintings are created during weddings, childbirth, and harvest
                festivals.Traditionally painted by married women, these artworks
                use white rice paste on mud walls coated with cow dung or red
                earth.A well-known motif is the Lagna Chaukat (Marriage Square),
                drawn before a wedding as a symbol of prosperity and
                celebration.
